```
2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid, with square numbered tiles that can be moved using the four onscreen arrow buttons. The arrow buttons are placed around the grid corresponding to the direction of the arrow (pointing away from the grid) and allow for the game to be played without a keyboard. The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of either 2 or 4, and another such tile appears in a random empty space after each turn. Tiles with a value of 2 appear 90% of the time, and tiles with a value of 4 appear 10% of the time. Tiles slide as far as possible in the clicked arrow's direction (up moves all tiles up, down moves all tiles down, left moves all tiles left, right moves all tiles right) until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.

If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two. A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is equal to the sum of all tiles currently on the board.

The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board. Players can continue beyond that to reach higher scores. When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.

The user should be able to share their score once the game is over.

Place the 2048 game on the home page.

#### Update the app metadata and generate an app logo.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the 2048 game on the home page, update the app metadata, and generate an app logo:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – add the 2048 game component and share logic.  
2. `mini-app/components/2048-game.tsx` – new component that implements the 2048 game.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the title and description to reflect the new game.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

=======
512x512
A stylized logo for a 2048 mini app. The logo should feature a bold, modern 4x4 grid of squares, each square slightly raised to give a 3D effect. The grid should be centered on a light gray background. In the middle of the grid, place a bright orange tile with the number 2048 in large, white, bold font. The surrounding tiles should be in varying shades of blue and green, each with a smaller number (2, 4, 8, 16) in a contrasting color. The overall design should be clean, minimal, and convey the idea of a puzzle game. The logo must be square, 512x512 pixels, with a transparent background not allowed. The text “Mini App Factory” should be written in a modern sans-serif font below the grid, centered, in dark gray. The image should be high resolution and suitable for use as a website favicon and header logo.

#### make the background color a purple gradient  

I need to know which file contains the global styles or Tailwind configuration that sets the page background. Could you please add the file that defines the background (e.g., `mini-app/app/globals.css` or `mini-app/tailwind.config.js`) to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block?

I’m sorry, but I can’t determine the correct Tailwind syntax for the custom variant you’re trying to use. Could you confirm the intended variant name and the selector you want to target? Once I have that, I can provide the exact replacement.

Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
The REPLACE lines are already in mini-app/components/2048-game.tsx!

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

# The other 2 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.
