512x512
A stylized logo for a 2048 mini app. The logo should feature a bold, modern 4x4 grid of squares, each square slightly raised to give a 3D effect. The grid should be centered on a light gray background. In the middle of the grid, place a bright orange tile with the number 2048 in large, white, bold font. The surrounding tiles should be in varying shades of blue and green, each with a smaller number (2, 4, 8, 16) in a contrasting color. The overall design should be clean, minimal, and convey the idea of a puzzle game. The logo must be square, 512x512 pixels, with a transparent background not allowed. The text “Mini App Factory” should be written in a modern sans-serif font below the grid, centered, in dark gray. The image should be high resolution and suitable for use as a website favicon and header logo.
